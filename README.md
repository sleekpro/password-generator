# password-generator

<p>
The Python Enhancement Proposal, PEP 506, advises developers to use the secrets module whenever a sequence should be cryptographically secure, such as passwords and security tokens.</p>

<p>
The secrets the module has several built-in functions that let you do the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate sequences of random numbers that are secure for cryptographic applications.</li>
<li>Use functions like <i>choice()</i>, <i>randbits()</i>, and <i>randbelow()</i> to generate secure random numbers.</li>
<li>Generate tokens for a password reset, temporary URLs, and more.</li>
</ul>
